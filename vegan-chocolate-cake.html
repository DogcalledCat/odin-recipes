        <h1>Vegan <em>Chocolate</em> Cake</h1>

        <h2>The best vegan chocolate cake in the land</h2>
            <p>A cake that will become a talking point for birthdays to come.
                Sweet and chocolately, the cocoa butter cream is an indulgent and moreish topping on the rich 
                and fluffy base. This recipe is really simple and has become my go to for any cake related event. It's
                a family favourite(they aren't even vegans). If you dont tell them, your non vegan friends
                will never know this cake was completely animal free because it's just so chocolatey!</p>

                <p>This recipe is easy to follow and is composed of ingredients you may already have 
                    in the pantry, or they'll atleast be easy to find in any local shops. Double ingredients to 
                    make twice as much, and customise with any toppings of your choice (I like to add rasberries to 
                     the middle for a sweet suprise and tart contrast to the chocolately goodness)</p>

                
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

        <p>This cake doesn't need any unsual ingredients or egg/dairy replacements, you may have to source some

            </ul>

            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

            <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/ 160°C fan/ Gas mark 4).
                     Lightly grease 2 x 20cm/8inch round baking pans</li>

                    <li>Stir the lemon juice (or vinegar) into the milk and 
                    set aside to thicken and 'curdle' slightly into buttermilk</li>

                    <li>In a pot over a medium heat, melt the butter, syrup and
                         coffee (if using) together. Set aside to cool slightly</li>

                    <li>Sift the flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder and baking
                         soda into a large mixing bowl and whisk together</li>

                    <li>Pour the milk and melted margarine mixture over the flour
                         mixture and stir well until it becomes a smooth batter</li>

                    <li>Divide the mixture between the two prepared pans and bake for
                         30-35 minutes or until an inserted skewer or toothpick comes out clean</li>

                    <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then turn out
                         onto a cooling rack to cool completely</li>

                    <li>Meanwhile, to make the icing beat together all ingredients until smooth</li>

                    <li>When the cakes are completely cold, sandwich together with half of the icing.
                         Spread the remaining icing over the top of the cake</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Notes</h3>

                <p>Substitute self raising flour - use the same amount as the plain flour,
                 but omit the 3 teaspoon of baking powder</p>

                <p>When you add the lemon juice to the vegan milk it may slightly curdle - don't worry,
                     that's what you want to happen! It's turning the plant milk into thicker buttermilk</p>
                
                <p>You can use any liquid sweetener: golden syrup, corn syrup, agave or maple syrup.
                     Maple makes for a slightly less sweet cake, but it's still really nice</p>

                <p>Don't overmix when you mix the wet and dry ingredients. You want it completely combined,
                     but stir gently and don't beat it.</p>
                   
                <p>Feel free to omit the coffee, it just enhances the flavour of the chocolate in this vegan cake</p>

                <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
